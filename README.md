# Automatic-thyroid-ultrasound-image-classification-using-feature-fusion-network
Nowadays, diagnosis of thyroid nodules is mainly based on clinical methods, which requires a lot of manpower and medical resources. Therefore, this work proposes an automated thyroid ultrasound nodule diagnosis method that combines convolutional neural networks and image texture features.
